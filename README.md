This is a GUI desktop application that allows scraping the products of the brands Hisense, Samsung, Admiral, and Konka, from the retailers Extra, Almanea, Carrefour KSA, and Zagzoog, which are four famous retailers for electronic appliances in Saudi Arabia. The results are saved as an Excel file, where the products of each website are saved in a separate sheet.
